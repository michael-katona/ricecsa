<p class="tab">Join us for part two of two in this mini-series called Healthy Habits. During this transition period, it can be very useful to find some healthy habits (through exercise and meditation) early on. For this second session, join us as we take a meditative walk around Inner Loop and share what tools we use to assist our faith life. First 10 women who show up will also receive what I call an "emergency bag" with some things like tissues, bandaids, and more! It'll be a nice productive study break, so please come and bring a friend :)</p>
